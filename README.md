## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Part 1: Backend Setup (PHP & MySQL via XAMPP)

1.  üì• Install XAMPP:
    * Download from official site: üîó [https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
    * Install on your system.

2.  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Services:
    * Open XAMPP Control Panel.
    * Start these services:
        * Apache (Web server)
        * MySQL (Database)

3.  üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup:
    * Access phpMyAdmin in your web browser:
        üîó http://localhost/phpmyadmin
    * Create Database:
        * Click "New" on the left sidebar.

* Name the database: robot_arm_flutt_db (ensure this name matches connectToDB.php).
    * **Create robot_arm_flutt table:**
        * Select the robot_arm_flutt_db database.
        * Go to the SQL tab and execute the following query:
           
            CREATE TABLE robot_arm_flutt (
                id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                motor1 INT,
                motor2 INT,
                motor3 INT,
                motor4 INT,
                motor5 INT,
                motor6 INT,
                status TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1
            );
            
üìÇ Deploy Project Files:**
    * Copy the entire robot_arm_control folder (containing your PHP, HTML, JS, CSS files) to your XAMPP's htdocs directory.
    * Example path: C:\xampp\htdocs\robot_arm_control

‚úÖ Test Database Connection (Optional):**
    * If needed, edit connectToDB.php to match your MySQL credentials (default XAMPP: user root, no password).
    * Open in browser: üîó http://localhost/robot_arm_control/connectToDB.php
        * You should see "Connection failed:" if there's an error, or nothing if successful (meaning it connected without issues).

üåê Launch Web Application (Optional):**
    * Open in browser: üîó http://localhost/robot_arm_control/index.html
    * You can now test the web interface directly.

### Part 2: Flutter Application Setup
 * üì• Install Flutter SDK:
   * Follow the official Flutter installation guide for your OS:
     üîó https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
 * ‚ú® Create a New Flutter Project:
   * Open your Command Prompt (CMD).
   * Navigate to a suitable directory where you want to create your Flutter project (e.g., cd C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\FlutterProjects).
   * Run the command to create a new Flutter app (replace robot_arm_app with your desired app name):
     flutter create robot_arm_app

   * Navigate into your newly created project directory:
     cd robot_arm_app

 * üìÑ Replace main.dart:
   * Locate the default main.dart file in your new project: robot_arm_app\lib\main.dart
   * Replace this file with your custom main.dart file that contains your robot arm control UI and logic.
     * (You would provide your main.dart separately or upload it to your GitHub repository for others to use.)
 * üì¶ Update pubspec.yaml Dependencies:
   * Open robot_arm_app\pubspec.yaml (this file manages project dependencies) using a text editor or IDE (like VS Code or Android Studio).
   * Under the dependencies: section, add the http and url_launcher packages as follows:
     dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^1.2.1 # Add this line
  url_launcher: ^6.2.5 # Add this line
  # The following section is for the development environment.
  # For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
  # following page: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec
  # The following section is specific to Flutter packages.

   * Save the file.
 * ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Backend IP Address (baseUrl):
   * CRUCIAL STEP: The Flutter app needs to know your PC's local IP address to communicate with the XAMPP server.
   * Find your PC's IP (Windows): Open Command Prompt and type ipconfig. Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter (Wi-Fi or Ethernet). E.g., 192.168.1.100.
   * Open robot_arm_app\lib\main.dart and update the baseUrl variable:
     final String baseUrl = "http://YOUR_PC_IP_ADDRESS/robot_arm_control";
// Example: final String baseUrl = "http://192.168.1.100/robot_arm_control";

   * IMPORTANT: Both your Android phone and PC must be connected to the same local network (same Wi-Fi router).

 * üîß Configure Android NDK Version:
   * To Install NDK via Android Studio:
     * Open Android Studio -> File -> Settings (or File -> Project Structure on some versions) -> Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Android SDK.
     * Go to "SDK Tools" tab, check "Android NDK (Side by side)".
     * Ensure the specific version (e.g., 27.0.12877973) is selected and "Installed". If not, download/install it.
 * üîê Configure Android Manifest Permissions:
   * Open robot_arm_app\android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml.
   * Ensure the following lines are present:
     * Inside the <manifest> tag (outside <application>):
       <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

     * Inside the <application> tag:
       <application
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    android:label="robot_arm_app"
    android:name="${applicationName}"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
    </application>

     * android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" is crucial for connecting to http:// (non-HTTPS) servers on Android 9+ devices.
 * üì¶ Install Flutter Packages (after pubspec.yaml update):
   * Inside the robot_arm_app directory (in your Command Prompt), run:
     flutter pub get
---

## üöÄ Running the Flutter App

1.  üì± Prepare your Android Phone:
    * Enable Developer Options: Go to Phone Settings -> About Phone -> Tap "Build Number" 7 times.
    * Enable USB Debugging: Go to Phone Settings -> Developer Options -> Enable "USB Debugging".
    * Allow USB Access: When connecting your phone to your PC via USB, allow "USB debugging" and "Always allow from this computer" when prompted.

2.  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Launch the App:
    * Ensure your phone is connected and recognized by your development environment (e.g., visible in VS Code's status bar or Android Studio's device dropdown).
    * In your terminal (within the robot_arm_app directory), run:
       
        flutter run
        
    * Flutter will build and install the app on your phone. The first build may take some time.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

* "Timeout reached waiting for exclusive access to file" / "Gradle threw an error while downloading artifacts":
    * Cause: Antivirus/firewall blocking Gradle, or an unstable/slow internet connection.
    * Solution: Temporarily disable antivirus/firewall, ensure stable internet. Clear Gradle cache by deleting contents of C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.gradle\wrapper\dists\. Then run flutter clean and flutter run.

* "Timeout waiting to lock build logic queue":
    * Cause: A stuck Gradle process or conflicting build attempts.
    * Solution: End java.exe or Gradle Daemon processes in Task Manager. Delete C:\flutter_projects\robot_arm_app\android\.gradle\noVersion\buildLogic.lock. Restart your computer for a clean slate, then flutter clean and flutter run.

* "NDK not configured. Download it with SDK manager.":
    * Cause: The specific NDK version required is not installed on your system.
    * Solution: Install the required NDK version (e.g., 27.0.12877973) via Android Studio SDK Manager (SDK Tools -> Android NDK (Side by side)).

* Buttons (Run / Save Pose) Not Working on Phone:
    * Cause: Connectivity issue between your Flutter app and the XAMPP server.
    * Solution:
        1.  Verify baseUrl in main.dart is your PC's correct local IP.
        2.  Ensure phone & PC are on the exact same Wi-Fi network.
        3.  Confirm Apache & MySQL are running in XAMPP.
        4.  Temporarily disable your PC's firewall for testing.
        5.  Double-check android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" and android.permission.INTERNET in AndroidManifest.xml.

* General Issues:
    * Run flutter doctor -v in your terminal and review its output for detailed diagnostics and suggested fixes.
